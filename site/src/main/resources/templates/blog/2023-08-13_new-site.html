    <h2>Welcome to the New Site!</h2>

    <p>The Brass Band results website was started in 2009, and it's been showing its age for a while.  Following several library upgrades over the years, the site was creaking around the edges and bits of it started breaking.  It was past the time that something was done about this.</p>
    <p>To sort out the various problems, I decided to rewrite the site from scratch, using modern technology, and modern commercial software techniques.  After over a year's work, this site is the result.</p>
    <p>I hope you'll agree that it's more consistent than before, and allows easier access to the same information.  There are a few new pages around the site which I'll highlight in coming blog entries, but feel free to have a look around and see what you can find.  As before we have the same split:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unregistered users have access to basic details about bands and contest results</li>
        <li>Registering for a free account allows you to add more results, edit results you've added, and build up your own personal contest history</li>
        <li>Paying for a pro account gets you access to pages that provide interpretation of our results database, giving insights into the best conductors and bands.  You're also helping to ensure the site lives on by helping with the hosting costs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One of the key innovations in this new site is intended to reduce the amount of feedback we get: anyone with an account can edit contest results until two weeks after the contest took place.  This means that you can easily and quickly add more detail to your results including conductors and points.  Another key change is that a band can only have one result for a contest.  No more will there be are multiple entries for the same band, each with part of the detail on.</p>
    <p>We hope you enjoy using the new site.  If you have any comments, suggestions, or you're missing something that the site used to do, please put your comment into the feedback box and we'll see what we can sort out.</p>
    <p>Thanks for your support.</p>
